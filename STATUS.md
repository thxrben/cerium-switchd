# Status / where to continue

Last updated: 2026-09-29.

## Done
- Phase 1.1–1.3: schema, config tree, set/curly/JSON formats, diff (tested + fuzzed).
- Commit-check validation (`internal/model`), interface-range, Junos MTU, three-plane stacking design.
- Spec: `docs/config-reference.md` (tests keep index, prose coverage and examples valid).
- Directives: `inactive:` / activate / deactivate (all formats, diff `!` lines, `Tree.Active()` used by
  `model.Build`), `load merge|replace|override|set` (atomic, `replace:`/`delete:`), `copy`, `rename`.
- Commit engine (`internal/commit`): FileStore (atomic writes, 50 revisions, pending state written before the
  revision it covers), sessions shared/private/exclusive, commit check incl. operator permissions,
  apply with revert on failure, confirmation (required/optional, stricter policy, timer restart, rollback to
  last confirmed, restart-safe), `config.Patch` for private `update`. Tested with fake clock/applier + race detector.
- CLI engine (`internal/cli`): operational + configuration mode, all §3.2 commands, commit variants, pipes,
  schema/config-aware completion and `?` help, Junos-style caret errors, permissions, panic recovery;
  file I/O and prompts go through the client (Terminal). Fuzzed (FuzzShell).
- RPC (`internal/rpc`, JSON lines, SO_PEERCRED auth), swcli client (`internal/swcli`: line editor, Tab/?,
  history, bracketed paste, pager, Ctrl-C interrupt, degraded mode), switchd daemon (`internal/daemon`, dry-run
  applier only). One binary: `swcli` is a symlink to `switchd`. `packaging/switchd.service`, `lab/deploy.yml`.
  Checkpoint A reached: running on sw1 in dry-run; commit/confirm/automatic rollback verified across a restart.
- Lab: all five VMs bootstrapped via Ansible (lab/), root key login works.
- Plan §4.15: OS ownership (takeover/release, masking conflicts, sysctls, foreign-change revert); lab install steps in §11.
- Plan §4.14: hitless reconfiguration (diff-driven, no link down, tighten-before-loosen, planner property tests).

## Next (in order)
1. `set … authentication plain-text-password` (prompt twice, store a $6$ hash); `start shell`;
   swcli as login shell for configured users (with OS account sync in Phase 4).
2. Phase 3 data plane on the lab VMs: netlink discovery/inventory, reconciler (hitless, §4.14),
   bridge/VLANs/access/trunk, MTU, LAGs, mgmt VRF, syslog. Replace the dry-run applier.

## Notes
- The dev machine is only for development: no network changes here; lab = Proxmox VMs (PLAN.md §11).
- Spec first: update docs/config-reference.md before implementing a feature.
